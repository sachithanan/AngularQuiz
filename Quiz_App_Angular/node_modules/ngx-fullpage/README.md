New: 
 - Project is updated to support Angular 7 !  
 
## Help wanted

As for now, I have no enough time to work on the this library. 
I am a backend developer, write Java / Python programs and that's the reason why library updates are so rare. I am not able to follow all the new trends in Angular, fullpage.js and frontend in general.

I am looking for collaborators who could help me to keep library up to date and resolve incoming PR's and issues.
If you are interested in it, contact me via email: meiblorn@gmail.com
